# A beginner Japanese roadmap

I'm writing it in my first month of jp, and I'm also planning to track the next steps here.

## Some notes

This is a roadmap of a complete beginner.

Also, the order matters: the order of the content is the order that I'm learning.

## The idea behind this guide

First off, I'm betting my time here to first learn to understand, that is, get **input**, then move to the **output**.

1. Unlock the "input mode": reading and listening.
2. Unlock the "output mode": writing and speaking.

## How much time

Everyday, as long you did not lose score, it's ok.

Test yourself using the challenge/test links, if you see you're better than yesterday, it's ok, keep going. If you are hardcore, then go **as much as you can**.

# Learning hiragana and hatakana

I'm learning kana through repetition, so these are some support resources that I did use to store the sounds along with it's characters in my long term memory:

- Duolingo, _Characters_ mode: https://www.duolingo.com/characters.
- A table mapping romaji and kana characters: https://codepen.io/alexrintt/full/VwxOxLb.
- Test your kana skills (main, dakuten, combination): https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com.
- Test your hiragana skills with a timer (main): https://www.jetpunk.com/user-quizzes/25526/hiragana-practice.
- Test your katakana skils with a timer (main): https://www.jetpunk.com/user-quizzes/25526/katakana-practice.

The only challenge here is to memorize everything, I do not wait to develop a "fast reading" because with kana you can read almost nothing but some foreign (English) words written in katakana.

So as long you are comfortable with these characters, even in "slow mode" you can skip to kanji, at least I did.

_Slow mode_ means: when you're strugging to read simple words, but you can read understand after some while, like: さよなら,　かぜ, さん,　です.

And I'll be very straight here: I did not learn anything by just looking or clicking on buttons, I full-filled an entire white-paper book with these characters, written by hand to _start_ being comfortable with it, all the contents placed in this sections must be used only as complements to your repetition based handwriting exercises.

_Tip: change preferred languages to Japanese where possible, it's pretty uncomfortable but over the time you will start to understand words, then phrases, then texts, and when you don't even notice you will be comfortable as if you are reading in English._
